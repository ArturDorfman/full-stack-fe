# Search Feature Implementation Plan for PostsList Component

## Background and Motivation
Currently, the PostsList component displays a list of posts with pagination functionality. The user wants to add a search feature to allow filtering posts by title or description, improving the user experience by making it easier to find specific content.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. The current API endpoint `/api/posts/` accepts `limit` and `offset` parameters but doesn't appear to have a search parameter in the schema.
2. We need to determine if the backend supports searching or if we need to implement client-side filtering.
3. The search feature should integrate well with the existing pagination system.
4. The UI should be responsive and provide immediate feedback during search operations.

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Add Search UI Component
- Add an Element Plus search input between the "Posts" heading and the "Add post" button.
- Implement responsive design to ensure the search field works well on all screen sizes.
- Add clear button functionality to reset the search.

**Success Criteria**: Search input is visually integrated into the UI and is responsive across different screen sizes.

### Task 2: Implement Search State Management
- Add a search query ref in the component.
- Implement debounce functionality to prevent excessive API calls while typing.
- Update the store to handle search parameters.

**Success Criteria**: Search state is properly managed with debounce functionality working correctly.

### Task 3: Update API Service and Store
- Modify the posts service to accept a search parameter.
- Update the store's getPosts method to include the search parameter.
- Ensure proper error handling for search operations.

**Success Criteria**: API service and store correctly handle search parameters and return filtered results.

### Task 4: Integrate Search with Pagination
- Reset pagination when a new search is performed.
- Ensure pagination works correctly with filtered results.
- Update the total count and pagination based on search results.

**Success Criteria**: Pagination works correctly with search results, showing the correct number of pages based on filtered data.

### Task 5: Add Loading State and Empty State
- Show loading indicator during search operations.
- Display an appropriate message when no results are found.
- Provide visual feedback during search operations.

**Success Criteria**: User receives appropriate feedback during and after search operations.

### Task 6: Testing and Refinement
- Test the search feature with various inputs.
- Ensure edge cases are handled properly (empty search, special characters, etc.).
- Optimize performance if needed.

**Success Criteria**: Search feature works reliably with all types of inputs and edge cases.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
I've implemented the search feature for the PostsList component. Here's a summary of the changes made:

1. **UI Component**: Added an Element Plus search input with a search icon between the "Posts" heading and the "Add post" button.

2. **Search State Management**: 
   - Added a `searchQuery` ref to track the search input
   - Implemented debounce functionality (300ms) to prevent excessive API calls while typing
   - Added a watch on the searchQuery to trigger search when it changes

3. **API Service and Store Updates**:
   - Updated the posts service and store to accept an optional search parameter
   - Created a centralized `fetchPosts` function that handles both initial loading and search operations

4. **Pagination Integration**:
   - Reset pagination to page 1 when a new search is performed
   - Updated the pagination component to only show when there are posts

5. **Loading and Empty States**:
   - Maintained the existing loading state during search operations
   - Added empty states with different messages for when no posts are found with or without search
   - Added a "Clear search" button when no results are found for a search query

### Testing Notes
The implementation needs to be tested for the following scenarios:

1. Search functionality works correctly with the backend API
2. Debounce prevents excessive API calls while typing
3. Pagination resets correctly when a new search is performed
4. Empty states display appropriately based on search context
5. Clear search button works as expected

### Potential Issues
The current implementation assumes the backend API supports a `search` parameter. If this is not the case, we may need to:
1. Update the backend to support search
2. Implement client-side filtering as a fallback
3. Modify the API call to use a different parameter name if required by the backend

## Lessons
No lessons learned yet as implementation has not begun.
